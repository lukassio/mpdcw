# Traffic Scotland Mobile Application

An application created in Android Studio using Java. This application parses data from https://trafficscotland.org and displays the current incidents, roadworks and planned roadworks. This application was for my Mobile Platform Development coursework.

# What I Learned
* Read an RSS feed
* Parse data from XML file 
* Develop a UI with XML files using buttons, views and text
* Display data in a scrollable list view in both landscape and portrait mode
* Add an image to each view based on the severity of the incident
* Search specific date on calendar or specific road on search bar

# How To Run 

1. Download the project source as a ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open Android Studio and navigate to the directory where this project was downloaded.
3. Open the folder of this project, Android Studio will now build the project with Gradle.
4. Once this process is complete, build the application by going to <i>Build>Make Project</i>.
5. If the app was built successfully, you can test it by running it on either a real Android mobile device, or an emulated one by going to <i>Run>Run 'app'</i> or by pressing the Run icon in the toolbar.
